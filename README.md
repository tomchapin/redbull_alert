redbull_alert
=============

Note: This was an experimental attempt to convert a friend's shell script to Ruby in a 1:1 manner (or at least as close to 1:1 as possible) to demonstrate some of the functionality of the Ruby language and the curses standard library.

Ruby:

Install Gem Dependencies:
> bundle install

Run the Script:
> ruby redbull.rb
